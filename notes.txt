Need to:
+ have transfers be open for late starters (can we have team created/transfer go through hours later like with swaps?)
+ add toggle for leaderboards to show late starters
+ add message saying cant make transfers until swaps go through, hence greyed out
+ hyperlink for matches in daily
+ add pro circuit tournaments so get data retrieves results
-+ test notification/achievement system
- make sure weekends worth double
+ handle uniques league to game, so only need to store league cookie, not game
- add charity stuff
- migrate user script
- check about updating Sale so stores swaps as well
- update rules/faq to talk about late starting
- have default league be latest week
- handle change league reloading with query param
- check string/int-ness of league cookie
- sweetAlert callback to reload page when confirmTransfer/swaps
- profile page
- update highest positions
