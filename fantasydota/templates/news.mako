    <h2>Heading into Grand Finals</h2>
    <p>
    The ideal heroes changed heavily between quarter-finals days. Luna dominated in the first day of them, with so many SD/Luna combo wins, with luna being the much cheaper of those two.
    However people who reacted and picked luna for today ended up not well off, as she was only picked up twice.</br>
    </br>

    The most valuable heroes from today were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><img src="/static/images/Lina_icon.png"/>Lina:  6.1 points/credit</li>
        <li><img src="/static/images/Clockwerk_icon.png"/>Clockwerk: 6.1 points/credit</li>
        <li><img src="/static/images/Legion_Commander_icon.png"/>Legion Commander: 5.6 points/credit</li>
        <li><img src="/static/images/Alchemist_icon.png"/>Alchemist: 3.7 points/credit</li>
        <li><img src="/static/images/Treant_Protector_icon.png"/>Treant Protector: 3.4 points/credit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Interestingly lina was only picked once, but it was a 2nd phase pick win, which for only 2.3 credits was a big deal.<br/>

    <a href="https://www.fantasydota.eu/leaderboard?rank_by=points&showGlobal=kek&period=day5">The 5th day</a> was won by <b>Liquid92</b>, mainly thanks to Timbersaw and Clockwerk. As well as Alchemist,
    who was in the day 5 team for everyone in top 17.
    </br>
    </br>

    Having been consistently hovering around the top ten for most of the tournament. His decision to leave out luna,
    unlike the majority of the other front-runners heading into quarters finals, has put him in pole position for the final day.
    </br>
    Although he has a 26 points gap, considering the day4 leader dropped to over 70 points behind, there are still multiple people with a chance of winning.
    </br>
    </br>
    For anyone who is too far off for league victory, there is a <a href="/battlecup">battlecup</a> style tournament set up for tomorrow:

    <h2>Group Stages: Most Valuable Heroes</h2>
    <p>
        The calibration of the hero values was based upon games at dreamleague and the summit 6. </br>
        The most valuable heroes over the group stage were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="/static/images/Rubick_icon.png"/>Rubick:  10.4 points/credit</li>
            <li><img src="/static/images/Alchemist_icon.png"/>Alchemist: 10.3 points/credit</li>
            <li><img src="/static/images/Pugna_icon.png"/>Pugna: 10.0 points/credit</li>
            <li><img src="/static/images/Dragon_Knight_icon.png"/>Dragon Knight: 9.9 points/credit</li>
            <li><img src="/static/images/Keeper_of_the_Light_icon.png"/>Keeper of the Light: 9.4 points/credit</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Part of these high scores come from calibration many analysing western dota. Pugna has only been picked by asian teams
        at Boston, as well as favouring rubick more often.</br>

        Alchemist enjoys his high spot mainly due to having lost only one game so far. Dragon Knight as well, has been mainly picked by OG,
        who won their group.

    </p>
